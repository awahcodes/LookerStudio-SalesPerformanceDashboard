# LookerStudio-SalesPerformanceDashboard

Overview

This analysis examines the sales performance of products over the period from 2021 to 2022, focusing on key metrics such as revenue generation, item pricing, discount usage, and geographic distribution of buyers. The dataset includes detailed records on coupon codes, sales trends, and SKU-specific performance, providing insights into the overall business strategy and areas for improvement.

Approach

•	Data Collection: Sales data was gathered from multiple transactions, capturing details such as product SKUs, revenue generated, discount codes applied, and buyer information.
   
•	Data Cleaning and Preparation: The dataset was processed to ensure completeness and accuracy, particularly in areas such as coupon code application and sales trends across different periods.
   
•	Analysis & Visualization: Using Looker studio, dashboards were created to visualize sales revenue, SKU distribution, campaign insights, and regional sales. The analysis focused on uncovering revenue trends, discount effectiveness, and sales performance by product and region.

Insights

•	Revenue Generation: The total revenue for the period was $2,068, with an average item price of $29.97 and a total of 69 items sold. Product SKU P017 contributed the highest share to revenue, accounting for 27.1% of sales.

•	Sales Distribution: Products P004, P003, and P017 dominated the sales distribution, collectively accounting for more than 59% of total sales.

•	Discount Impact: The largest campaign, "Coupon Promo", generated $1,674 in sales without applying any discounts. Other campaigns, like CYBER2021, contributed $224 in revenue with a 56% discount, highlighting varying promotional effectiveness.

•	Sales Trend: The sales trend showed fluctuations over the months, with peaks around November and December 2021, likely due to holiday promotions. However, there were noticeable dips in early 2022.

•	Regional Focus: Sales were predominantly from a few key regions, suggesting opportunities for expansion into underrepresented markets.


Recommendations

•	Product Strategy: Given that a few products (e.g., P017, P004) dominate sales, consider focusing future campaigns on these high-performing SKUs to maximize revenue.

•	Promotional Strategy: While some coupon codes like CYBER2021 drove sales, they also resulted in heavy discounts. Future campaigns should aim for better balance between discount offerings and revenue generation to maintain profitability.

•	Sales Expansion: Regional data indicates a concentration of buyers from a limited number of countries. Expanding marketing efforts to underperforming regions could increase the customer base and revenue.

•	Seasonal Marketing: The noticeable spikes in November and December suggest an opportunity to further leverage seasonal promotions. Preparing tailored campaigns for key sales periods can help boost end-of-year revenue.
